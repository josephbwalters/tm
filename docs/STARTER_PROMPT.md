## Project One‑Liner
A local‑first, Vim‑style terminal task tracker with Markdown truth + SQLite index, modal TUI, plugin host, and project/task/subtask hierarchy. Think: the Neovim of tasks.

## Scope
- Offline‑first; single user v1; sync/plugins later.
- Thousands of tasks; dozens of projects; dotfile configs.
- Extensible via Lua plugins; FS/network open v1; perms model later.
